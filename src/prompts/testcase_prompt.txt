Guidelines:
** Include all the positive, negative, boundary value analysis
** Test case should be in below format:
Ex :  Tests for create user end point - 
1.  Test Case Name - Verify user creation is successful
    Steps: 
    Step1: Make POST call to create a new user - https://api.example.com/v1/users
        Payload - {
            "username": "abc",
            "email": "user@example.com",
            "password": "pass123"
        }
    Expected Results:
        1. Response Status Code should be 201
        2. Response schema should be like below,
        {
            "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
            "username": "abc",
            "email": "user@example.com"
        }
        3. Verify that username and email matches with user payload
        4. Unique ID should be returned

2.  Test Case Name - User creation should fail if username field length is less than 3 characters
    Steps: 
    Step1: Make POST call to create a new user - https://api.example.com/v1/users
        Payload - {
            "username": "ab",
            "email": "user@example.com",
            "password": "pass123"
        }
    Expected Results:
        1. Status Code should be 400
        2. Response schema should be like below,
        {
            "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
            "message": "One or more input fields are invalid.",
            "details": [
                {
                    "field": "username",
                    "issue": "Username must be between 3 and 20 characters long.",
                    "value": "ab",
                    "code": "USERNAME_LENGTH_INVALID"
                }
            ]
        }

3.  Test Case Name - User creation should fail if username field length is more than 20 characters
    Steps: 
    Step1: Make POST call to create a new user - https://api.example.com/v1/users
        Payload - {
            "username": "abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde",
            "email": "user@example.com",
            "password": "pass123"
        }
    Expected Results:
        1. Status Code should be 400
        2. Response schema should be like below,
        {
            "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
            "message": "One or more input fields are invalid.",
            "details": [

                }
            ]
        }

--- 
AFTER reviewing the guidelines above, generate the FULL test plan for the selected endpoint in JSON format. Your response should be in a JSON array with each test case as an object like this:

[
  {
    "name": "Test Case Name",
    "preCondition": "Any pre-conditions",
    "steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", ...],
    "expectedResults": ["Expected Result 1", "Expected Result 2", ...]
  }
]

Do not include extra commentary or lines before/after the JSON object.
